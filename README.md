# Python_Server_Framework
The following scripts are written to demonstrate the use of various Python server frameworks. Python xmlrpc.server — Basic XML-RPC servers: The xmlrpc.server module provides a basic server framework for XML-RPC servers written in Python. Servers can either be free standing, using SimpleXMLRPCServer, or embedded in a CGI environment, using CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler. SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler.rpc_paths: An attribute value that must be a tuple listing valid path portions of the URL for receiving XML-RPC requests. Requests posted to other paths will result in a 404 “no such page” HTTP error. If this tuple is empty, all paths will be considered valid. The default value is ('/', '/RPC2'). xmlrpc.client — XML-RPC client access: XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call method that uses XML passed via HTTP(S) as a transport. With it, a client can call methods with parameters on a remote server (the server is named by a URI) and get back structured data. This module supports writing XML-RPC client code; it handles all the details of translating between conformable Python objects.
