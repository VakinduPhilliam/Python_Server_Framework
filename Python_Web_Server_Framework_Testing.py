# Python Web Server Framework
# wsgiref — WSGI Utilities and Reference Implementation
# The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a standard interface between web server software and web applications written in Python.
# Having a standard interface makes it easy to use an application that supports WSGI with a number of different web servers.
#
# wsgiref.util.setup_testing_defaults(environ).
# This routine adds various parameters required for WSGI, including HTTP_HOST, SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORT, REQUEST_METHOD, SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO, and
# all of the PEP 3333-defined wsgi.* variables. It only supplies default values, and does not replace any existing settings for these variables.
# 
# This routine is intended to make it easier for unit tests of WSGI servers and applications to set up dummy environments.
# It should NOT be used by actual WSGI servers or applications, since the data is fake!
# 
# Example usage:
# 

from wsgiref.util import setup_testing_defaults
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

# A relatively simple WSGI application. It's going to print out the
# environment dictionary after being updated by setup_testing_defaults

def simple_app(environ, start_response):
    setup_testing_defaults(environ)

    status = '200 OK'
    headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')]

    start_response(status, headers)

    ret = [("%s: %s\n" % (key, value)).encode("utf-8")

           for key, value in environ.items()]
    return ret

with make_server('', 8000, simple_app) as httpd:
    print("Serving on port 8000...")

    httpd.serve_forever()
