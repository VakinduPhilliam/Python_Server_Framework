# Python Server Framework.
# xmlrpc.client — XML-RPC client access.
# XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call method that uses XML passed via HTTP(S) as a transport.
# With it, a client can call methods with parameters on a remote server (the server is named by a URI) and get back structured data.
# This module supports writing XML-RPC client code; it handles all the details of translating between conformable Python objects and
# XML on the wire.
#
# Convenience Functions:
# xmlrpc.client.dumps(params, methodname=None, methodresponse=None, encoding=None, allow_none=False)
# Convert params into an XML-RPC request. or into a response if methodresponse is true. params can be either a tuple of arguments or an
# instance of the Fault exception class. If methodresponse is true, only a single value can be returned, meaning that params must be of
# length 1. encoding, if supplied, is the encoding to use in the generated XML; the default is UTF-8.
# Python’s None value cannot be used in standard XML-RPC; to allow using it via an extension, provide a true value for allow_none.
# xmlrpc.client.loads(data, use_datetime=False, use_builtin_types=False) 
# Convert an XML-RPC request or response into Python objects, a (params, methodname). params is a tuple of argument; methodname is a string, or
# None if no method name is present in the packet. If the XML-RPC packet represents a fault condition, this function will raise a Fault exception.
# The use_builtin_types flag can be used to cause date/time values to be presented as datetime.datetime objects and binary data to be presented as
# bytes objects; this flag is false by default.
# 
# The obsolete use_datetime flag is similar to use_builtin_types but it applies only to date/time values.
# 
# Server Usage
# 
# To access an XML-RPC server through a HTTP proxy, you need to define a custom transport. The following example shows how:
# 

import http.client
import xmlrpc.client

class ProxiedTransport(xmlrpc.client.Transport):

    def set_proxy(self, host, port=None, headers=None):

        self.proxy = host, port
        self.proxy_headers = headers

    def make_connection(self, host):

        connection = http.client.HTTPConnection(*self.proxy)
        connection.set_tunnel(host, headers=self.proxy_headers)

        self._connection = host, connection

        return connection

transport = ProxiedTransport()
transport.set_proxy('proxy-server', 8080)

server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('http://betty.userland.com', transport=transport)

print(server.examples.getStateName(41))
